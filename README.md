# üöÄ Serverless API for Customer, Sales, and Product Management with AWS Lambda (Python)

This project is a Serverless API developed to manage customers, sales, and products using AWS Lambda, AWS API Gateway, and DynamoDB. Deployment is done with AWS Chalice, simplifying the implementation and management of Lambda functions.

## üìå API Architecture

The API follows this structure:

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run the API

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites
- **AWS CLI** configured
- **Python 3.x** installed
- **AWS Chalice** installed:
  ```bash
  pip install chalice
  ```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:guiipedroso/serverless-api-lambda.git
cd serverless-api-lambda
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy with AWS Chalice
To deploy to AWS using Chalice:
```bash
chalice deploy
```
This will automatically create the Lambda functions, API Gateway, and necessary configurations.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally
To test the API locally:
```bash
chalice local --port 8090
```
The API will be available at `http://localhost:8090`

## üìú Testing
To run unit tests:
```bash
pytest
```
To test with Postman, import the endpoint collection (link to be added later).
